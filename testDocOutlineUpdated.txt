Don’t need to be more detailed in out description

Stalled out motor :( 
Could plot the actual positions sent to the motor and make sure info sent to motor is correct
Bad cable :( very sad
Could draw less power by setting dps limits
Could set a fixed speed that is slow enough to not draw enough power but will still only take within 3 min
Cable manage near the end 
Flag potential problems:
Can ease of use be defined?
So can ease of use be defined? We define ease of use by the amount of time it takes to set up the puzzle, the amount of time it takes to solve the puzzle, and the amount of time it takes to reset the puzzle.
